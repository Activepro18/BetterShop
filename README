To build, you need to include the following as libraries:
    bukkit.jar	(current build used git-Bukkit-0.0.0-493-g8b5496e-b493jnks)
    iConomy.jar
    Permissions.jar

If you want helpful bukkit javadocs, you should get:
    the Bukkit source code

Once it builds, compress on linux using:
    jar or an equivalent archiver
      jenny:~/workspace/BetterShop/bin$ jar -cf BetterShop.jar *

or on Windows using:
    I have no clue. I guess something similar to jar.

And it's ready to be placed in a plugins directory :)

In-Game Commands:
/shop				for those used to a plugin having one command, this is another way to get to the following
/shophelp (shelp)		shows you all the commands you can use
/shoplist (sl,slist)		shows a listing of items for sale
/shopitems (sitems)		show full listing of items in shop, without prices
/shopcheck (sc,scheck)		lookup a specific item so you don't have to read through pages of prices
/shopbuy (buy,sbuy): 		buy an item for the price in the shopshop ("all" is accepted as an amount)
/shopbuyall (buyall,sbuyall): 	buy all of an item that you can hold
/shopsell (sell,ssell):  	sell an item for the price in the shop
/shopadd (sadd): 		add an item to or update an item in the price list
/shopremove (sremove): 		remove an item from the price list
/shopload (sload): 		reload prices from pricelist database
/shopsellall (sellall):		Sell all of item from your inventory (alias to command /shop sell all)
/shopbuystack (buystack): 	buy a stack of an item (usually 64)
/shopbuyagain (buyagain,sba): 	repeat last buy action
/shopsellagain (sellagain,ssa): repeat last sell action
/shopkits (skits):		show a listing of avalliable kits (will be elaborated later)

toadd: 
/shopvalue item[@amount] item  shows the current trade value for two items

Features:

currently dependent on iConomy
Permissions support
Fully configurable colors and message text in config.yml file
Every item and subtype can be priced differently
Disable selling or buying of an item or subtype by giving it a price of -1
Item sub-type support for dye colors, cloth colors, etc: magentacloth = 35:2 = cloth:magenta
command aliases to stop carpal tunnel
MySQL pricelist support 
Transaction records (MySQL only right now)
Downloads mysql-bin.jar dependency automatically
"all" is a valid amount when selling: "/sell cobblestone all" or "/sell all cobblestone"
shoplist can have text alignment (read config for more info): <item> <l(eft-aligned)> <buy and sell info>
Configurable max pagesize when printing shoplist
shopsellall can be given multiple items (/sell all cobble gravel flint dirt)

Permissions:
Just add the following nodes to Permissions' config.yml file (or data.yml file for GroupManager):

- 'BetterShop.user.*'
^ Allows the user to use the list, sell, buy, and help commands
- 'BetterShop.admin.*'
^ Allows the user to use the add, remove, and load commands

There are other nodes that allow only more specific permissions, but I recommend using the above.
They work like this:
BetterShop.user.list
BetterShop.user.check
BetterShop.user.buy
BetterShop.user.help
BetterShop.user.sell
BetterShop.admin.add
BetterShop.admin.remove
BetterShop.admin.load
BetterShop.admin.info
BetterShop.admin.illegal	# gives the ability to purchase 'illegal' items

There are two ways to add things to the shop:
Recommended, but slow: use /shopadd [item] [buy-price] [sell-price]
Faster, but more error prone: use a text editor (or spreadsheet) to add items to the BetterShop.csv file. 
	BUT add an item using method 1 first, so you can see how it needs to be formatted. 
	The name value is there only for human readability, it's not read by the plugin.


todo:
damaged tools can be sold for price*(1-(damage/maxdamage))\
/shopvalue item[@amount] item  to show the current trade value for two items
buystack with multiple inputs (eg. "/buystack wood coal")
discount system: users or groups can be charged less/more for an item or all items (sell prices also affected)
fix kits.. still aren't working :(


Changelog: 

Version 1.6.0 - jascotty2
major code restructure & reorganization 
changed item db to a more descriptive yml file
- can define what items make an item (for calculated/dynamic costs)
- can change what color it will be outputted as in the listing
[]- define kits (sold.. store won't buy them)
MySQL buy & sell fields increased to decimal(11,2), and cap in program set to 999,999,999
shoplist can now optionally not show listing tail (or head, but recommended to leave <page> of <pages>)

-	and "all" to try to buy as many as they can hold
items can be marked as illegal, and can only be purchased by a select few (using permissions)
-	also not shown to users who cannot buy them
option in config to make transactions publicly broadcasted
option in config to have a custom sort order
shopsellall can be given multiple items (/sell all cobble gravel flint dirt)
now shows what items were sold when using shopsellall
fixed bug where single sell parameter would == sell [item] all
all, full, -1 added as a pricelist pagenumber: will print the full list (intended for console use)
marketactivity table truncate logic repaired.. 
marketactivity MySQL table changed with primary key(DATE, USER, ID) (instead of DATE, USER) to resolve conflits with sellall
items can be marked as 'legal: false', and only those with permissions can buy them (can still sell)
if encounters errors while editing a player's account, will attempt to reload iConomy
sellall can be given "inv" as first parameter to only sell from inventory (not in quick access slots)
shopcheck given partial name matching: "/shopcheck wool" (not "shopcheck 35") will show all colored wool prices :)

Version 1.5.9b - jascotty2
width outputting in minecraft chat (for /shoplist): now can have item (or listing) right-align, left-align, or centered
implemented transaction log and total transactions record
no longer dependent on permissions: if missing, ops have .admin.* & everyone has .user.*
bugs: MySQL buy & sell is decimal(6,2), limiting price to 9,999 (plus a nondescriptive error)
	- to fix (db minecraft, table BetterShop): 
		alter table minecraft.BetterShop change column buy buy decimal(11,2);
		alter table minecraft.BetterShop change column sell sell decimal(11,2);
     unkown error: MySQL connection seems to get dropped & won't connect until restart plugin
		seems to stem from iConomy (v4.4 (Arcadia)) or v0.2 [Coelho].. i only have 4.4, but .2 is being logged
		shopload should fix this, but iconomy will still be down.. if you have a plugin like hotswap, reload iConomy
     not a bug, but forgot to remove: logs select statements being executed

Version 1.5.8(?) - jascotty2
( the (?) means plugin didn't report that as the version.. sorry :))

Version 1.5.7(?) - jascotty2
